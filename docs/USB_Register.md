####3. Run eReuseOS
  1. Connect the USB with the eReuseOS image to the PC where you are going to register.
  2. Configure the BIOS (the first few seconds when computer starts) to boot on USB.
  1. Maybe there is a option to automatically boot from USB.
    - Watch for the BIOS Setup Message.
    - Press F12, F8 or F9 to enter on boot menu selection.
  2. Enter to Setup and change the boot priority.
    - Watch for the BIOS Setup Message. 
    - Press F2 or F10 to enter on BIOS menu. 

####4. Inventory process register hardware characteristics of a computer
1. When system starts, it will ask you for some fields.
   (Optional) If you have a PXE server on LAN you can choose the fields to ask.

2. You will need to fill the following fields:
   - Label (optional): to help identifying the PC. (e.g.: PC­1, PC­2, PC­3...) .
   - Comment (optional): to introduce extra information (e.g.: describe If any of peripheral equipment does not work).
   - Device type: choose what kind of equipment are you registering (e.g.: Desktop, Laptop, etc).

3. Wait until inventory gets all the information from equipment.

4. By default, a SMART check will start to execute. (takes 1 minute approximately)

5. A erasing process will start.
    - By default, it will ask for every hard drive if you want to do a secure erase. (it takes some hours)
    
6. (Optional) If a server is available, will try to upload the JSON.

5. You will be asked to insert another USB drive to store the result, just plug­in and wait until the result is saved.

7. Process is done! If you want to review the result open the file stored on the USB on another computer or just run this command on the inventoried device (where “your_filename” is the name of the file printed on the screen):

  ![jsondevice](./images/json_device-inventory.png)
  - `less /tmp/your_filename.json`

8. Press `q` to quit the program, unplug the USB and you can power off the computer.
  - `sudo poweroff`  # introduce this command or just press computer’s power button
